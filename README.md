# Interpreters  

A collection of interpreters written in various programming languages as a way to deepen my understanding of both interpreter design and new languages. This project is inspired by *Writing an Interpreter in Go* by Thorsten Ball ([official website](https://interpreterbook.com)).  

## 📌 About  
The goal of this repository is to implement interpreters in different languages to explore parsing, evaluation, and execution in diverse programming paradigms. By building interpreters from scratch, I aim to get hands-on experience with:  

- Lexical analysis (tokenization)  
- Parsing techniques  
- Abstract syntax trees (ASTs)  
- Evaluation and execution models  
- Memory and scope handling  

## 🚀 Implementations  
Each implementation will be structured in its own directory with documentation, source code, and notes on language-specific insights.  

Planned languages include:  
- [ ] **Java** (following *Writing an Interpreter in Go*)  
- [ ] **Python**  
- [ ] **Kotlin**  

## 📚 References

- Other references and notes will be added as the project evolves
